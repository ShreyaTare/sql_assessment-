# Codecademy Learners Mockup Data

## Overview
This project involves analyzing mockup Codecademy learners data using SQL. You will be working with two tables: `users` and `progress`. The `users` table contains the following columns:
- `user_id`: The unique identifier for each user.
- `email_domain`: The domain of the user's email address.
- `country`: The country where the user is located.
- `postal`: The postal code of the user's location.
- `mobile_app`: Indicates whether the user is using the mobile app (Yes/No).
- `sign_up_at`: The timestamp when the user signed up.

The `progress` table contains the following columns:
- `user_id`: The unique identifier for each user.
- `learn_cpp`: Indicates whether the user is learning C++ (Yes/No).
- `learn_sql`: Indicates whether the user is learning SQL (Yes/No).
- `learn_html`: Indicates whether the user is learning HTML (Yes/No).
- `learn_javascript`: Indicates whether the user is learning JavaScript (Yes/No).
- `learn_java`: Indicates whether the user is learning Java (Yes/No).

## Project Goals
The goals of this project are to:
1. Utilize SQL knowledge to analyze the mockup Codecademy learners data.
2. Gain insights from the data by performing various SQL queries and calculations.

## Technology Used
The main technology used for this project is:
- SQLite: A lightweight relational database management system that allows you to store and manipulate data using SQL.

## Setup Instructions
If you choose to work on this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, follow these instructions:
1. Click the "Download" button to obtain the necessary project files.
2. Set up SQLite on your computer by referring to our SQLite setup guide.
3. Run SQL commands from your terminal or install DB Browser, a desktop application, to execute SQL queries. You can find instructions on running SQL commands in DB Browser in our article.

### Installation
1. Install SQLite: Visit the [SQLite website](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and download the appropriate installation package for your operating system.
2. Follow the installation instructions provided with the SQLite package to complete the installation on your computer.
